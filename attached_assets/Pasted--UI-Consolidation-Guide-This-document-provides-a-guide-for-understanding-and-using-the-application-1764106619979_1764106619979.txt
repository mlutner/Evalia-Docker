# UI Consolidation Guide

This document provides a guide for understanding and using the application's design system to ensure a consistent and maintainable UI.

## 1. The Existing Design System: Your Single Source of Truth

Your application already has a well-structured design system that serves as a single source of truth for all UI elements. This system is documented in `client/src/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` and is built from a few key files that work together to ensure consistency.

### 1.1. Core Files

*   **`client/src/index.css`:** This is the foundation of the entire system. It defines all the core design tokens (colors, fonts, spacing, etc.) as CSS variables. **To change a core color or style across the entire application, you only need to change it here.**
*   **`client/src/theme.ts`:** This file imports the CSS variables from `index.css` and exports them as a JavaScript object. This allows you to use your design tokens directly in your React components in a type-safe way.
*   **`client/src/buttons.ts` & `client/src/cards.ts`:** These files define the different styles for your button and card components. They use the variables from `theme.ts` to create consistent, reusable styles.

### 1.2. How It Works

1.  **Define a Style:** A core style (like a color) is defined as a CSS variable in `index.css`.
2.  **Expose it to Code:** The variable is imported and exposed through the `theme.ts` file.
3.  **Create a Component Style:** A specific component style (like the "primary button") is created in `buttons.ts` or `cards.ts` using the theme variables.
4.  **Use it in a Component:** A React component then uses the style from `buttons.ts` or `cards.ts` to ensure it matches the design system.

By following this model, you can change a color in `index.css`, and that change will automatically be reflected in every button, card, and component that uses that color.

## 2. How to Use the Design System

To ensure consistency, all new and existing components should use the design system. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to do this.

### 2.1. For Buttons

Instead of styling a button manually, import the `ButtonSystem` from `buttons.ts` and use the predefined styles.

**Do this:**

```tsx
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { ButtonSystem } from "@/buttons";

function MyComponent() {
  return <Button className={ButtonSystem.primaryTeal.className}>Click Me</Button>;
}
```

**Avoid this:**

```tsx
// This uses a hardcoded color and is not consistent with the design system
function MyComponent() {
  return <button style={{ backgroundColor: "#1F6F78", color: "white" }}>Click Me</button>;
}
```

### 2.2. For Cards

Similarly, use the `CardSystem` from `cards.ts` for all card-like containers.

**Do this:**

```tsx
import { Card } from "@/components/ui/card";
import { CardSystem } from "@/cards";

function MyComponent() {
  return <Card className={CardSystem.standard.className}>...</Card>;
}
```

**Avoid this:**

```tsx
// This uses one-off styles and is not consistent
function MyComponent() {
  return <div style={{ border: "1px solid #E2E7EF", borderRadius: "12px", padding: "24px" }}>...</div>;
}
```

### 2.3. For Colors and Other Styles

For any other component that needs to use a color, font, or spacing from the design system, import the `theme` object from `theme.ts`.

**Do this:**

```tsx
import { theme } from "@/theme";

function MyComponent() {
  return <div style={{ color: theme.colors.primaryText }}>Hello World</div>;
}
```

**Avoid this:**

```tsx
// This uses a hardcoded color that will not update if the theme changes
function MyComponent() {
  return <div style={{ color: "#1C2635" }}>Hello World</div>;
}
```
