Summary

Purpose: Likely measures leadership effectiveness (e.g., communication, decision-making, team trust).

Common Sections:

1. Leadership Skills (e.g., "How well does your leader communicate goals?" – Likert scale 1–5).
2. Team Dynamics (e.g., "Do you feel supported by your leader?").
3. Growth & Feedback (e.g., "How often do you receive constructive feedback?").
4. Open-Ended (e.g., "What’s one thing your leader could improve?").
Strengths:

•
Covers key leadership dimensions.
•
Mixes quantitative (scores) and qualitative (comments) data.

3 Key Improvements

1. Sharpen Focus:
•
Problem: Too broad → weak actionable insights.
•
Fix: Align questions to 1–2 specific goals (e.g., "Improve psychological safety" or "Increase transparency").
•
Example: Replace "How effective is your leader?" with "How often does your leader share the ‘why’ behind decisions?" (measures transparency).
2. Avoid Bias:
•
Problem: Leading questions (e.g., "How great is your leader’s communication?").
•
Fix: Use neutral wording:
•
❌ "How supportive is your leader?"
•
✅ "How often does your leader provide the resources you need?" (scored 1–5: Never to Always).
3. Add Behavior-Based Questions:
•
Problem: Vague traits (e.g., "Is your leader inspirational?") → hard to act on.
•
Fix: Ask about observable actions:
•
✅ "In the past month, how many times did your leader publicly recognize your work?" (0 / 1–2 / 3+).
•
✅ "When you raise a concern, how often is it addressed within a week?" (scale).

Pro Tips

•
Scoring: Use a rubric (e.g., 1–2 = "Needs Improvement," 4–5 = "Strength") to auto-categorize responses.
•
AI Assist: Let Evalia’s AI generate insights from open-ended responses (e.g., "30% mention ‘lack of 1:1s’").
•
Share: Use QR codes for in-person training evals or email links for remote teams.

Next Steps:

1. Edit your survey in Evalia (use Templates > "Leadership 360" for inspiration).
2. Pilot with 5–10 respondents to test clarity.
3. Analyze with Evalia’s Analytics tab—focus on low-scoring questions first.
