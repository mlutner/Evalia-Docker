Short answer:
Yes, you can do OCR through OpenRouter, and you have two main paths:

Use OpenRouter’s built-in PDF engines (including an OCR engine).

Use a vision model (VLM) that’s been trained for OCR and ask it to “read” the page.

For Evalia, option 1 + a bit of 2 is the sane combo.

1. OpenRouter’s built-in PDF → text / OCR

OpenRouter now has universal PDF support with a file-parser plugin and different engines:

pdf-text – text-only extraction (no OCR), free, great for normal PDFs that already contain text.

mistral-ocr – full OCR for scanned docs / images inside PDFs, ~$2 per 1,000 pages.

For Evalia, that means:

Most training decks / exported handouts → pdf-text (free).

Old scanned worksheets / photos → mistral-ocr when needed.

You don’t change models for this; you add a plugin config on the request.

Example: PDF → text for survey generation (TypeScript with OpenAI SDK)
import OpenAI from "openai";

const client = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENROUTER_API_KEY!,
  baseURL: "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1",
});

export async function generateSurveyFromPdf(pdfUrl: string) {
  const completion = await client.chat.completions.create(
    {
      model: "moonshotai/kimi-k2:free", // or your surveyGeneration pool
      messages: [
        {
          role: "user",
          content: [
            {
              type: "text",
              text:
                "Read this training PDF and extract the key topics and learning " +
                "objectives, then draft a 15-question post-training evaluation survey.",
            },
            {
              type: "input_file",
              file_url: pdfUrl, // public URL or presigned URL of the PDF
            },
          ],
        },
      ],
      // 👇 PDF plugin – choose the extraction engine
      plugins: [
        {
          id: "file-parser",
          pdf: {
            engine: "pdf-text", // or "mistral-ocr" for scanned docs
          },
        },
      ],
    },
    {
      headers: {
        "HTTP-Referer": "https://evalia.app",
        "X-Title": "Evalia",
      },
    },
  );

  return completion.choices[0]?.message?.content ?? "";
}


For most Evalia use, pdf-text will be enough and costs you nothing.
