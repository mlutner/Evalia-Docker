1. The page still feels empty above the fold

You’ve compacted the text but kept a massive dead zone between:

Stepper section

“How would you like to start?”

On a 1440px display, this looks like “scroll down for the real content.”

Impact:
Users interpret empty vertical space as lack of importance.
It visually disconnects the flow: step → choice.

Fix:
Pull “How would you like to start?” up by at least 80–120px.
Shrink the vertical gap between stepper and hero text.

2. The “Recommended for most” badge is floating awkwardly

Right now it looks:

Visually detached

A bit like an afterthought

Slightly misaligned with the card

Impact:
It creates a tiny credibility wobble.
It should look intentional, not patched on.

Fix options:

Move it inside the card, top-left, like a tag chip.

Or shift it slightly up/left and reduce its height by ~20%.

3. The three options are still visually too similar

You reduced copy, but the three cards still feel like “three white rectangles with icons.”

This is a cognitive load problem.
Users won’t differentiate them quickly enough.

Fix:
Add subtle visual cues:

Template → soft blue accent on icon

AI → soft purple or teal

Import → soft gray

Even slight color-coding anchors visual memory.

4. Card descriptions are still a bit generic

Your new copy is better, but still vague. Users benefit from specificity.

Example:

Create with AI
“Tell us your goals — AI builds your survey for you.”

This can be sharpened:

→ “Describe what you want to measure. AI generates a complete survey draft.”

Micro-precision = confidence.

5. The stepper still feels informational, not actionable

You're almost there — but step 2 and 3 still read like neutral statements.

Try making them more verb-first:

Build Questions
“Refine and customize questions with AI guidance.”

Publish
“Apply scoring, add logic, and launch your survey.”

This small tweak increases momentum.

6. The whole flow lacks a single, dominant CTA

Right now, each card acts like a CTA, but none feels like the CTA.

You don’t need a giant “Continue” button — but you need something that anchors the user’s eye.

Fix:
Increase the card’s hover elevation by one small step:

Slight shadow lift

Slight border-color shift

Slight background tint change

This tells the user:
“Choosing a card is the primary action.”
