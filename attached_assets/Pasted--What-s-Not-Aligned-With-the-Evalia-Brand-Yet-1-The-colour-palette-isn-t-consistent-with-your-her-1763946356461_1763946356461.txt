🎨 What’s Not Aligned With the Evalia Brand Yet
1. The colour palette isn’t consistent with your hero / marketing

Your branding uses:

Deep Navy

Teal / Aqua Blue

Lime Green accent

White / Light background

Your dashboard uses:

Dark navy sidebar (good)

Random teal/blue for charts (fine but inconsistent)

Pale yellow icons (not part of brand)

Flat green for accents (not your lime)

There’s no cohesive system linking marketing → dashboard → surveys.

2. Iconography style is inconsistent

You’re mixing:

thin-line icons

shadows with gradients

flat monochrome icons

Evalia needs:

clean, thin-line icons

a single 2-color system (navy + teal, or navy + lime)

Right now icons feel “drop-in,” not unified.

3. The AI Insights panel feels visually disconnected

It feels like a browser extension, not part of the dashboard.

Spacing, card height, and colour accents differ from the main grid.

The brand voice of Evalia is:

clarity

intelligence

calm competence

The insights panel needs to visually reflect that.

4. The charts aren’t on-brand

Lines and bars are default colors.
Evalia should use:

Primary chart color: teal #1F8EFA
Secondary chart color: navy #0D1B2A (muted)
Highlight color: lime #A8E05E (sparingly)

Your charts should feel like part of your identity, not template defaults.

5. “Response Rate 100%” card feels visually flat

It doesn’t have the same visual weight or brand feeling as the others.

The KPIs should feel like one cohesive set.

6. Typography should match your marketing site

Your hero uses:

Bold uppercase headline

Rounded, generous line height

Modern geometric sans-serif

Your dashboard uses something more generic.

Even small typography alignment changes help unify the experience.

🟦 Now, here’s how to align it with Evalia branding (exact steps)
① Apply a defined color system
Primary Colors

Navy: #0D1B2A

Deep Blue: #1F3B58

Teal Blue: #1F8EFA

Accent

Lime: #A8E05E (use sparingly)

Greys

Background: #F5F7FA

Borders: #E7EBF0

Text: #1C2B36

Where to apply

KPI icons: use the teal + navy

Insight icons: use lime only for “warnings”

Sidebar hover state: teal highlight

Buttons: lime or teal (pick one for consistency)

② Standardize icon style

Use:

Thin line

2 px stroke

Rounded corners

No gradients

No shadows

Always teal or navy

Make your iconography feel like a “kit,” not mix-and-match.

③ Redesign the AI Insights panel to match the grid

Right now it's too visually different.

Make it:

same card style (shadow, radius, padding)

slightly narrower but aligned vertically

teal-toned icons

consistent typography

no bright yellow

If you want to keep warning colours, use:

Lime = caution

Teal = info

Navy = neutral

This matches your brand palette.

④ Bring in brand elements subtly (not heavy)

Examples:

A thin teal vertical line on the left of KPI cards

A subtle lime indicator dot on charts

Very light gradient overlay (top right → bottom left)

A soft teal shadow under highlight components

Evalia’s brand shouldn’t scream — it should hum.

⑤ Use your marketing typography

Use a modern type like:

Inter

Satoshi

Plus Jakarta Sans

Manrope

Keep:

Headline in medium/bold

Body text 16px

KPI numbers at 28–32px

Insights text 14–15px

Sidebar text 14–15px, medium

Typography consistency = brand consistency.

⑥ Improve the “information architecture”

Two changes:

A. KPI cards

Give each card a mini-label:

“6 Surveys” → “Created this month”

“Avg Score” → “Across all scoring models”

“Response Rate” → “Across all surveys”

Adds context and clarity.

B. Chart titles

Make them more human:

“Response Trends” → “How engagement changes over time”

“Category Breakdown” → “Skills ratings across dimensions”

Evalia’s voice is clear, helpful, human.

⑦ Add a soft background pattern

Evalia’s branding uses:

smooth curves

subtle gradients

soft patterns

Add a very faint pattern to the “white” background
(e.g., 2% teal gradient in top right).

This helps the dashboard feel like part of the marketing website.
