OPTIMAL USER FLOW WITH MICRO-STEPS (REAL PRODUCT LOGIC)

Here’s how it should actually feel inside the app:

⸻

STEP 1 — Choose Type

Survey
“Collect feedback & reactions.”

Assessment
“Measure knowledge, skills, and behavior change with scoring.”

Cognitive mode: intention-setting.

⸻

STEP 2 — Choose Build Method
	•	Start from template
	•	Create with AI
	•	Import from PDF/Document

Here the user chooses their starting point, not their structure.

Cognitive mode: momentum.

⸻

STEP 3 — Build Questions (Editor Screen)

This should be the heart of the product.

On this screen, users can:

For surveys:
	•	Add Likert
	•	Add rating
	•	Add text
	•	Add multi-select
	•	Ask AI to refine a question
	•	Convert text → question with one click

For assessments:
	•	Add MCQs
	•	Add scenario questions
	•	Add scale scoring
	•	Add correct answer
	•	Add per-response scoring
	•	Add explanations

IMPORTANT:
Don’t bring scoring bands here — only scoring per question.

Cognitive mode: content creation. Stay clean, stay focused.

⸻

STEP 4 — Logic & Structure
	•	Reorder sections
	•	Add branching rules
	•	Add skip logic
	•	Group questions into categories (important for assessment bands)

Cognitive mode: structure/organization.

⸻

STEP 5 — Design & Experience

This is where your current flow mixes things too early.

Here, users customize:
	•	Cover image
	•	Brand color
	•	Title & subtitle
	•	Intro message
	•	Thank-you page
	•	Custom redirect URL
	•	Email confirmations
	•	Branding removal (paid tier)

Cognitive mode: visual expression.

⸻

STEP 6 — Scoring & Interpretation (Assessments only)

This is a whole separate mental mode. Keep it isolated.

Here users configure:
	•	Score categories
	•	Scoring ranges
	•	Labels (e.g., Needs Development / Proficient / Mastery)
	•	Personalized feedback text
	•	Recommended next steps
	•	Category-specific interpretation
	•	AI-generated feedback (optional)

This is the “value” moment for assessments — don’t bury it.

Cognitive mode: evaluation meaning-making. Very different from writing questions.

⸻

STEP 7 — Preview

Let them:
	•	simulate responses
	•	see scoring
	•	see feedback
	•	test branching
	•	test mobile view
	•	test accessibility

Cognitive mode: final check.

⸻

STEP 8 — Publish

Allow:
	•	Share link
	•	Embed
	•	QR code
	•	LMS export (future)
	•	API integration (future)
	•	Email invitations
	•	Anonymous vs identified mode
