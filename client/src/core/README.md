# Core (Client)

This folder is reserved for cross-cutting client modules that power the app foundation:

- Shared types and adapters that sit above raw API calls.
- Global state primitives (contexts/hooks) that are reused outside a single feature area.
- Normalization helpers for surveys, scoring, design settings, and analytics payloads.

Use this space to keep foundational utilities discoverable and decoupled from feature-specific components.
